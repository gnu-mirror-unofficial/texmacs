<H2>Structured documents</H2>

<p>
A main advantage of using TeXmacs as a text editor is that it helps and
encourages you to write so called <em>structured documents</em>. Let us
briefly explain what we mean by this. If you look at a printed book, then you
will notice that it has been subdivided into <em>chapters</em>, a
<em>table of contents</em>, an <em>index</em> and so on. The start of a
chapter is usually indicated by a <em>page break</em> and a title in a
clearly distinguishable font. Moreover, the title of the chapter is often
used as a <em>header</em> for all pages in that chapter. Inside a chapter,
there may be other special pieces of text, like citations, definitions,
theorems, etc. which are typesetted in a different way from the main text.
</p>

<p>
Two approaches can be distinguished in order to write a book or a shorter
document with the above features. The first, so called
<em>visual approach</em> consists of taking care of
all typesetting issues yourself. This means that you will
have to choose the appropriate character font each time
that you start a new chapter or theorem and that you have to number these
chapters and theorems yourself. The second
<em>structured document approach</em> requires you to tell
the computer when you want to start a new chapter or theorem.
The <em>document style</em> is responsible for choosing a
nice way to typeset chapter titles, theorems, etc.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of the visual approach is that it may seem a bit simpler and
natural for a newcomer, because it involves only little operations (such as
changing the font size, selecting a bold or italic font, etc.). Moreover,
most commercial text editors encourage you to use it. However, the visual
approach has many disadvantages with respect to the structured document
approach:
<OL>
  <LI> The visual approach is not <em>flexible</em>. Imagine for instance that
  you started to write a document in which the titles of the chapters use a 14
  points bold font. If you change your mind somewhere in the middle and prefer
  a 15 points font instead, then you have to modify the titles of all chapters.
  Similarly, if you start a new chapter in between two others, then you have to
  renumber all chapters yourself. </LI>

  <LI> The visual approach lacks <em>semantics</em>. When starting a new
  chapter using the structured document approach, you give the computer
  <em>extra information</em> about the titles and locations of the chapters in
  your book. This information may for instance be used for the automatic
  generation of tables of contents or for the creation of headers. Actually,
  this information may even be used for purposes that you may not yet be aware
  of. For instance, one may imagine editing facilities for jumping from one
  section to the next or the previous one. </LI>

  <LI> The visual approach needs more <em>expertise</em>. Indeed, a
  professional bookprinter has learned a lot about how to typeset a book in a
  very attractive way. The actual layout of the book and the fonts which have
  been used are the result of careful thought. A typical user does not have the
  required expertise for this job. Usually, he will therefore obtain a better
  result by using a predefined document style. </LI>
</OL>
For the above reasons TeXmacs encourages you to use the structured document
approach, although we still support the visual approach. Indeed, the visual
approach may sometimes be handy for certain exceptional situations. Below, we
will give some very simple examples of both approaches.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a document style</h2>

<p>
After having giving a name to your document, the next thing you usually should
do is select a <em>document style</em>. Although you might skip this step in
principle, we strongly recommend you not to do so. The document style is
responsable for the general layout of your document, which can either be a
letter, an article a book, or something else (an experienced TeXmacs user may
even define his own document styles).
</p>

<p>
There are multiple advantages to document styles. First of all, they allow you
to structure your document into chapters, sections, subsections, etc.
Secondly, TeXmacs is responsable for typesetting such structured documents in
a beautiful and coherent way, which fullfills the highest typesseting
standards required by professinal publishing companies.
</p>

<p>
Document styles are selected from the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_style.gif" ALT="style icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu or the <b>Document->style</b> submenu.
Notice the change in the left footer after the selection of a document style.
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/style-1.png" ALT="Select style (step 1)" BORDER=0>
  <BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/style-2.png" ALT="Select style (step 2)" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<h2>Subdivision of a document into sections</h2>

Depending on the document style, a text is usually subdivided into chapters
(in the case of a book or a thesis) or into sections (in the case of
articles, letters, etc.). In order to start a new section,
you should select <b>section</b> in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_section.gif" ALT="section icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu or the <b>Insert->section</b> menu.
When starting with an empty document,
you should observe the following change on your screen:

<center><p>
  <TABLE HALIGN="center" VALIGN="center">
    <TR>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-1.png"
             ALT="Starting a section (step 1)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-2.png"
             ALT="Starting a section (step 2)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
    <TR>
  </TABLE>
</p></center>

<p>
Notice the change of the size of the cursor. The left footer shows
that the section title will appear in 14 points bold face font.
The right footer indicates that you are at the start of typing
the title of a section. When you finished to type your section title,
you have to move the cursor to the right in order to indicate that
you are finished (and return to the normal text):
</p>

<center><p>
  <TABLE HALIGN="center" VALIGN="center">
    <TR>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-3.png"
             ALT="Starting a section (step 3)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-4.png"
             ALT="Starting a section (step 4)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
    <TR>
  </TABLE>
</p></center>

<p>
Observe that the left footer indicates that you are again using
the usual 10 points computer modern roman font. The right footer
indicates that your cursor is after the section title
(after the expansion of the section <em>macro</em>).
In order to continue typing, you should first go to the next line
by pushing the <tt>return</tt> or <tt>enter</tt> key.
Next you may type the body of your section.
</p>

<center><p>
  <TABLE HALIGN="center" VALIGN="center">
    <TR>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-5.png"
             ALT="Entering the section body (step 1)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
      <TD>
        <IMG SRC="../Images/section-6.png"
             ALT="Entering the section body (step 2)" BORDER=0>
      </TD>
    <TR>
  </TABLE>
</p></center>

<p>
  At this point it is interesting to change <em>a posteriori</em>
  your document style, in order to get a small taste of the power
  of structured documents. After selection of the <em>article</em>
  document style, the sections will be numbered:
</p>

<center><p>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/section-7.png"
       ALT="Changing the document style" BORDER=0>
</p></center>

<H2>Changing the font</H2>

<p>
In order to manually change the character font, you have to look in the menu
<b>Text->font</b>. The current font is determined by several
characteristics: its name, family, series, shape and size. Any combination of
these characteristics lead to a different font; this will be described in
more detail later. In our sample text, we want to type a french word in
italic, so we select the italic font shape:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-1.png" ALT="Select font 1" BORDER=0><BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-2.png" ALT="Select font 2" BORDER=0><BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-3.png" ALT="Select font 3" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
In order to type the french accented `é' character in the word
<em>beauté</em>, you should use the keybinding <tt>esc ' e</tt>.
This is a general way to obtain accented characters. For instance,
the german character `ü' is obtained by typing <tt>esc " u</tt>.
Many other keybindings exist in TeXmacs, which will be discussed later.
Below we have indicated what happens after you successively press
<tt>esc</tt>, <tt>'</tt> and <tt>e</tt>.
Notice the information displayed on the footer.
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-4.png" ALT="Select font 4" BORDER=0><BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-5.png" ALT="Select font 5" BORDER=0><BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-6.png" ALT="Select font 6" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
When you have finished to type the italic text and you want to get back to the
original font, then you should position the cursor after the italic text.
This can either be done by pressing on the right arrow key <tt>-></tt>,
or by clicking on the left mouse button well behind the word
<tt>beaut&eacute;</tt>. Both the left footer and the slope of
the cursor indicate that you are typing using an upright font.
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-7.png" ALT="Select font 7" BORDER=0><BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-8.png" ALT="Select font 8" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
Do not forget to regularly save the changes in your document by pressing
<tt>F3</tt> or using <b>File->save</b>. TeXmacs also automatically saves your
document every two minutes. You may recognize the autosaving from the message
below on the footer:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Old/font-9.png" ALT="Select font 9" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
When you attempt to load a file in which you made some unsaved changes then
you may be prompted with the question whether you wish to load a more recent
autosave file.
