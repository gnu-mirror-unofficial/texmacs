<H2>Starting TeXmacs up</H2>

<p>
Assume that you have started up TeXmacs, so that you have a window like below
on your screen:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/start.png" ALT="Starting TeXmacs" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
Before you start typing a new text, we recommend you to perform the following
steps:
<UL>
  <LI> Give your text a name under which it will be saved.
       This will enable be you to find your document back. </LI>
  <LI> Select the language of your document. </LI>
  <LI> Select the document style (letter, article, book, etc.). </LI>
</UL>
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we will only describe the first step.
In <A HREF="../Chapter4/Chapter4.html">chapter 4</A>,
we will discuss how to type texts in foreign languages.
In <A HREF="../Chapter5/Chapter5.html">chapter 5</A>,
we discuss the importance of document styles.
The default document style is a <em>letter</em>.
</p>

<H2>Giving your document a name</H2>

<p>
We recommend you to give your document a name before you start to edit it,
by saving it under a new name.
This is achieved by selecting the <b>save buffer as</b> item in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_save.gif" ALT="save icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu or the <b>save as</b> item in the <b>file</b> menu:
press the left mouse button on
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_save.gif" ALT="save icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">,
move your cursor to <b>save buffer as</b> while maintaining the left mouse
button pressed, and release the left mouse button.
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/saveas-1.png" ALT="Save TeXmacs file (step 1)" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
Notice that you could have achieved the same thing by simultaneously
pressing the <tt>shift</tt> and the <tt>F3</tt> keys,
as suggested by the <em>help balloon</em>.
This help balloon automatically shows up when leaving
the mouse pointer on the <b>save buffer as</b> for a while.
After you released the left mouse button,
a new window of the following form pops up:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/saveas-2.png" ALT="Save TeXmacs file (step 2)" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
This window is also called a <em>file browser</em>,
because you can interactively choose a <em>file name</em> and
a directory where to save your file,
by using the keyboard or the mouse.
In the example, <tt>..</tt>, <tt>images</tt>, <tt>phonetic</tt> and
<tt>test</tt> are the parent directory and subdirectories of
the current directory. The file <tt>demo.tm</tt> is an already
existing TeXmacs file in the current directory.
The buttons <b>home</b> and <b>texts</b> can be used to
return to your home directory or a special directory
for TeXmacs documents.
</p>

<p>
In order to finish the action of giving our text a name,
we just type <tt>test.tm</tt> in the <b>File:</b> field
and press on <b>Ok</b>:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/saveas-3.png" ALT="Save TeXmacs file (step 3)" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
We notice that you should always let your file name end by
the <tt>.tm</tt> <em>suffix</em>, so that anyone can recognize
that your file is a TeXmacs document. After giving your text
a name, your main window should look like
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/saveas-4.png" ALT="Save TeXmacs file (step 4)" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
First of all, you may notice the change of the title of your window.
Furthermore, a message on the footer confirms the name change.
</p>

<H2>Writing a simple text</H2>

<p>
Once you have given your document a name, you may start to type your text.
In <A HREF="../Chapter4/Chapter4.html">chapter 4</A>, we will explain how
to type special characters, which are necessary for writing texts in
foreign languages. The following is a sample text, which you may try
to type as an exercise:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/simple-1.png" ALT="A simple text" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
When you are done with typing, we recommend you to first save your document,
using the <b>save buffer</b> item in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_save.gif" ALT="save icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu, or by pressing the <tt>F3</tt> key.
A message on the footer should confirm the success of this operation:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/simple-2.png" ALT="Save the simple text" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
For your safety, TeXmacs actually <em>autosaves</em> your document
every two minutes. If you forgot to save your document before closing
TeXmacs, or if your computer is unpowered for some reason,
then you will be prompted whether you want to retrieve
the last unsaved changes in your document as soon as you
try to load it. Again a message on the footer confirms autosaving:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/simple-3.png" ALT="Autosave the simple text" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
When you are done with typing, you usually want to print your document out.
This can be done by selecting the <b>print all</b> item in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_print.gif" ALT="print icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu, or by pressing the <tt>F4</tt> key. Before printing,
it might be that you want to setup your printer,
by pushing the <b>setup printer</b> item in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_print.gif" ALT="print icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu. You will then be prompted for the printing command you
want to use (like <tt>lpr</tt>), the paper type of your printer
(like <tt>a4</tt> in Europe or <tt>letter</tt> in the USA)
and the printer's precision in dots per inch (<tt>600</tt> is default).
</p>

<p>
In order to retrieve your text after closing TeXmacs,
you first have to push the <b>load buffer</b> item in the
<IMG SRC="../Xpms/tm_load.gif" ALT="load icon" BORDER=0 ALIGN="top">
icon menu or hit the <tt>F2</tt> key. Next, you may select your
file using the file browser. In our example, the file <tt>test.tm</tt>
indeed appears in the file browser and we may retrieve it
by rapidly clicking twice on it.
