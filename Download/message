                     Welcome to GNU TeXmacs
----------------------------------------------------------------

GNU TeXmacs is a free what-you-see-is-what-you-get scientific text editor,
which was both inspired by TeX and GNU Emacs. It is also possible to
use TeXmacs as an interface to computer algebra systems.
TeXmacs actually runs on PC's under Gnu-linux (a >200MHz processor
and >32Mb of memory are recommended) and on sun computers.

The program implements high quality typesetting using TeX fonts,
but it is also provides a user friendly interface.
The high typesetting quality also goes through for automatically
generated formulas; this makes GNU TeXmacs suitable as an interface
for computer algebra systems. Finally, TeXmacs supports
the Guile/Scheme extension language, which makes it possible to
adapt the user interface to specific needs and even to extend the editor.

Currently, the editor is more or less compatible with the TeX system and
we are working on the interface with computer algebra systems.
Subsequently, GNU TeXmacs should also support graphics and
some hypertext features.
