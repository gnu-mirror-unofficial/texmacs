  Installation of packages required by GNU TeXmacs
</FONT></B><BR></P>

<BR>

<P>
  In order to run GNU TeXmacs, you should have installed a TeX
  distribution on your system, as well as the Guile/Scheme
  extension language. Below, we shortly describe how to do this.
  For descriptions of TeX and Guile and useful links,
  <A href="../Web/Links1.html">click here</A>.

<H2><b>1. Installation of a TeX system</b></H2>

<P>
  The installation of a functional TeX distribution on your system
  can be a complicated job. We recommend you to install the teTeX,
  which has been most extensively tested in combination with TeXmacs.
</P>

<P>
  If you use redhat linux or another linux distribution (like mandrake)
  which supports the <tt>rpm</tt> command, then teTeX is most
  easily installed using this facility. You should first
  <A HREF="http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/tetex.html">download</A>
  the teTeX distribution which corresponds to your platform.
  An rpm package <tt>[package]-[version].rpm</tt>
  is installed by root using
  <pre>
    rpm -i [package]-[version].rpm
  </pre>
  An rpm package may depend on other rpm packages.
  When installing a package, you will be informed on missing dependencies.
  In our case you will probably need to install the
  <A HREF="http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/tetex-fonts.html">teTeX fonts</A>
  too. In order to know whether a particular package
  <tt>[package]-[version].rpm</tt> has been installed
  on your system, you should type
  <pre>
    rpm -q [package]
  </pre>
  In particular, before installing teTeX, you should try
  <pre>
    rpm -q tetex
  </pre>
  in order to know whether the package is already there on your system.
</P>

<P>
  If you do not have the <tt>rpm</tt> program, then you may
  download it from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/rpm-3.0.x/rpm-3.0.4.i386.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/rpm-3.0.x</A>
  and unpack it in the <tt>/</tt> directory as root.
  You may also
  <A HREF="ftp://www.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/current/distrib/INSTALL">download</A>
  teTeX from CTAN by following the instructions given there.
</P>

<H2><b>2. Installation of guile</b></H2>

<P>
  The easiest way to install Guile is again by downloading
  the rpm packages
  <A HREF="http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/guile.html">guile</A> and
  <A HREF="http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/guile-devel.html">guile-devel</A>
  which correspond to your platform and install them in a similar way as above.
  Otherwise, you may download the source code of the official Guile
  distribution from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile/guile-1.3.4.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile</A>
  and follow the instructions below.
</P>

<P>
  If you have the permission to log yourself as root,
  then it is preferable that you log yourself as root and
  install the package by
  <pre>
    gunzip -c guile-1.3.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd guile-1.3.4
    ./configure
    make
    make install
  </pre>
  This will install Guile into <tt>/usr/local/share/guile</tt>.
  The Guile  binaries and libraries will be installed in
  <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> respectively.
  You should set the paths <tt>GUILE_LOAD_PATH</tt>, <tt>PATH</tt> and
  <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> accordingly, using
  <pre>
    export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/share/guile/1.3.4
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>
    setenv GUILE_LOAD_PATH /usr/local/share/guile/1.3.4
    setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  </pre>
  as a function of your shell.
</P>

<P>
  If you do not have the possibility to log yourself as root,
  and if your system administrator is not willing to install
  Guile in the above way, then you may also install
  Guile in another directory <tt>[dir]</tt> as follows.
  <pre>
    gunzip -c guile-1.3.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd guile-1.3.4
    ./configure --prefix=[dir]
    make
    make install
  </pre>
  In this case, Guile will be installed in the directory
  <tt>[dir]</tt>. The Guile binaries resp. libraries can
  be found in the subdirectories <tt>[dir]/bin</tt> resp.
  <tt>[dir]/lib</tt>. You should set the paths <tt>GUILE_LOAD_PATH</tt>,
  <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> accordingly, using
  <pre>
    export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=[dir]/share/guile/1.3.4
    export PATH=[dir]/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[dir]/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>
    setenv GUILE_LOAD_PATH [dir]/share/guile/1.3.4
    setenv PATH [dir]/bin:$PATH
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH [dir]/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  </pre>
  as a function of your shell.
</P>

<P>
  You may also download Guile from its official
  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">home page</A>.
  You will also find more documentation about Guile there.
