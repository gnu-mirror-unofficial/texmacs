<H2>Starting TeXmacs up</H2>

<p>
You may start TeXmacs by typing
<pre>
    texmacs &
</pre>
The first time that you start TeXmacs, the program will analyze your system
in order to test whether all other packages which are needed by TeXmacs
are present on your system. If no problems occur,
then a <em>window</em> with the following aspect should appear on your screen:
</p>

<p><center>
  <IMG SRC="../Images/start.png" ALT="Starting TeXmacs" BORDER=0>
</center></p>

<p>
If this is not the case, then the messages displayed by TeXmacs may help
you to track down possible installation problems. In the case that you
do not manage to get TeXmacs working, you may
<A HREF="http://www.texmacs.org">consult the TeXmacs web-pages</A> on
<pre>
    http://www.texmacs.org
</pre>
or you may contact the author of TeXmacs at
<pre>
    vdhoeven@texmacs.org

</p>

<H2>Understanding the TeXmacs window</H2>

<p>
The following figure illustrates some common notions, like menu,
scrollbar, etc., which will be frequently referred to in this manual:
</p>

</center></p>

<p>
The <em>title bar</em> displays the name of your text.
In the above example, the text was not yet given a name.
</p>

<p>
At the left and the right hand sides of the title bar you usually also
see some <em>window decorations</em>. These <em>buttons</em>
have some special effects when you click on them with the mouse.
In the above example, they may for instance be used to minimize or
to maximize the TeXmacs window, or to close down TeXmacs.
In general, the window decorations depend on the <em>window manager</em>
you are using, a program which is independent from TeXmacs.
</p>

<p>
Your text itself will be displayed in the <em>canvas</em>.
If the text does not fit into the window, then you may use
the <em>horizontal</em> and the <em>vertical scrollbars</em>
to scroll through the text and go to the particular piece that
you want to edit. The <em>caret</em> or <em>cursor</em> indicates
the particular position in the text where you are typing.
You may move it by clicking on the left mouse button.
</p>

<p>
The <em>menus</em> on the <em>menu bar</em> may be used to
access special text editing facilities. For instance,
the <em>buffer menu</em> allows you to access to several
texts which you may edit at the same time.
The <em>file menu</em> allows you to save and reload
your texts and to print them out. The <em>text menu</em>
allows you to change the text font, the current language,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The lower <em>status bar</em> or <em>footer</em>,
which is divided into a <em>left</em> and a <em>right footer</em>,
displays some of the most relevant information concerning
your text. In the above example, the left footer indicates that
we are writing a letter in text mode, using a ten points roman character font.
The right footer indicates that our cursor is located at the start of
a paragraph.
