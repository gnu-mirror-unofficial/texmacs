<H3><b>Generalities</b></H3>

<P>
  One of the best ways to contribute to GNU TeXmacs is by using it a lot,
  talk about it to friends and collegues, and to report us about bugs
  or other unnatural behaviour. Please mention the fact that you wrote
  articles using TeXmacs when submitting them. Besides these general
  (but very important) ways to contribute, your help on the more
  specific subjects below would be appreciated. Don't hesitate to
  <A HREF="Mail.html">contact</A> us if you want to contribute
  to these or any other issues.
</P>

<P>
  Notice also that there are several interesting projects
  for scientific research and development related to TeXmacs.
  Such work might be done in the context of a PhD, a post-doc,
  or whatever you would like (if appropriate funding can be found).
  If you are interested by this, please inform us about your
  particular interests and ask us for more information.
</P>

<P>
  In order to find documentation about the source code of TeXmacs,
  you may consult the menu <b>Help->implementation</b> inside the program.
  More <A HREF="Manual.html">documentation</A> is available from
  the web pages.
</P>

<P>
  A new and efficient (though experimental) way to contribute to
  the TeXmacs documentation and support is via the
  <A HREF="http://www.alqua.com/tmresources" TARGET="_top">TeXmacs Wiki</A>.
  This is an interactive forum where users can ask questions about
  specific topics, but also participate themselves to the documentation
  effort and to answering questions from other users. In the future,
  the whole TeXmacs website might work in a similar way.
</P>

<H3><b>Documentation</b></H3>

<P>
  A big effort has still to be spent on the documentation of TeXmacs.
  Not only good documentation is very useful for new users,
  but writing such documentation is also a nice way for you
  to learn more about the program. If you are limited in time,
  then you may consider writing documentation about one
  particular feature of TeXmacs, such as ``typing mathematics'',
  ``using environments'' or ``writing a style file''.
  A good idea might be to illustrate your documentation
  by small, cartoon-like screen samples (see the
  <A HREF="../Tutorial/index.html" TARGET="_top">tutorial</A>).
</P>

<H3><b>Translations</b></H3>

<P>
  The support of a maximal number of foreign languages is another
  major challenge in which your help would be appreciated.
  Usually, the procedure for a new language is as follows
  <UL>
    <LI>
      You copy the file <tt>english-new.scm</tt> to
      <tt>english-yourlanguage.dic</tt> in <tt>langs/natural/dic</tt> and
      fill out the corresponding translations. You may want to use
      Andrey Grozin's dictionary tool at
<pre>
    http://www.texmacs.org/Data/dictool.py.gz
</pre>
      In order to use it, may sure that Python is installed on your system,
      download the file, gunzip it, make it executable and run it.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      You tell us about any special typographical rules in your language
      and handy keystrokes for producing special characters.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      We take care of the hyphenation and typographical issues,
      but you test them.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      If you have enough time, you may also consider the translation
      of (part of) the existing documentation.
    </LI>
  </UL>
  Of course, the support for languages get out of date each time that
  new features are added to TeXmacs. For this reason, we also maintain
  a file <tt>miss-english-yourlanguage.dic</tt> with all missing translations
  for your language, once that it has been added. Please do not hesitate
  to send inclomplete versions of <tt>english-yourlanguage.dic</tt> or
  <tt>miss-english-yourlanguage.dic</tt>; someone else may be willing to
  complete them.
</P>

<H3><b>Converters to other data formats</b></H3>

<P>
  If you are familiar with TeX, LaTeX, Html, Xml, Sgml,
  Mathml, Pdf, Rtf, or any other frequently used data format,
  please consider contributing to writing good converters
  for one or more of these formats.
</P>

<P>
  Writing a specific converter for Pdf should not be very difficult,
  by adapting the file <tt>src/Window/PsDevice/printer.gen.cc</tt>.
  Converters for other formats may be more complicated to write,
  and might sometimes  require a closer collaboration with
  the main TeXmacs authors. In the submenu
  <b>Help->implementation->data</b> of TeXmacs,
  you will find details about the TeXmacs data format
  and in <b>Help->implementation->data conversion</b>
  we give some useful suggestions for writing converters.
</P>

<H3><b>Porting TeXmacs to other platforms</b></H3>

<P>
  Having only access to PC/Linux and SUN systems,
  We are interested in people who want to port TeXmacs
  to other Unix systems with X Window and
  to maintain the corresponding distributions.
  If you want to do this, you should take a look at the files
  <pre>
      gencc/src/system.h
      src/Basic/fast_alloc.gen.cc
  </pre>
  Specialists on <tt>autoconf</tt> and <tt>rpm</tt> packages are
  also invited to communicate their suggestions, patches, etc.
</P>

<P>
  Besides porting TeXmacs to other Unix-based systems,
  it would be nice to port TeXmacs to Windows (and Mac OS).
  A first possibility might be to port TeXmacs to Cygwin and
  run an X server under Windows. We would very much appreciate
  feedback from people who have tried to do this.
  A cleaner, but more laborious approach would be to
  port the (modular) window interface of TeXmacs to
  a more portable graphical user interface like
  Gtk, GNUstep or Qt. For this task, some of our
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.texmacs.org/pub/TeXmacs/misc">test programs</A>,
  might be useful. Some (unfinished)
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.texmacs.org/pub/TeXmacs/misc/Source-doc.tar.gz">documentation of TeXmacs' source code</A>
  by David Allouche is also available.
</P>

<H3><b>Interfacing TeXmacs with other programs</b></H3>

<P>
  It is quite easy to write interfaces between TeXmacs and
  computer algebra systems or other scientific programs with
  structured output. Please consider writing interfaces
  between TeXmacs and yout favorite system(s).
  TeXmacs has already been interfaced with several
  other <A HREF="Links3.html">free systems</A>.
  For more information about how to add new interfaces,
  see the <b>Help->interfaces</b> menu item inside TeXmacs.
</P>

<H3><b>Other possible contributions</b></H3>

<UL>
  <LI>
    Grammar checkers and automatic translation programs.
    Does someone know where to find detailed free dictionaries and
    stuff like that?
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Incorporation of a free speech recognition program.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Rewrite the window interface in a way that it becomes based
    on <tt>Gtk</tt> (or another graphical user interface)
    instead of X Window (and provide an interface with <tt>guile-gtk</tt>).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Etc...
  </LI>
</UL>
