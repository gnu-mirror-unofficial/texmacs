  Software that GNU TeXmacs depends on
</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>
  In order to run GNU TeXmacs, you should have installed a TeX distribution
  on your system, as well as the Guile/Scheme extension language.
  Below, we will shortly describe these packages and give some useful links.
  For more installation on how to install TeX and Guile,

<H2>1. The TeX typesetting system</H2>

<P>
  TeX (= tau epsilon chi, and pronounced as "tecch")
  is a computer language for use in mathematical typesetting,
  developed by D.E. Knuth from the late 1970s until the late 1980s.
  The main aim was to provide output with a typesetting quality that
  you would expect in nicely printed books.
  In the meantime, D.E. Knuth also developed Metafont,
  a tool to automatically generate nice looking (mathematical)
  character fonts. In the 1980s and 1990s TeX
  has been extended by many people, given rise for instance
  to LaTeX, amsTeX and so on.
  Current TeX distributions usually contain all these
  different programs.
</P>

<P>
  In order to use TeXmacs, it is assumed that you have
  installed a TeX system on your system,
  although TeXmacs really only uses the Metafont
  program to generate its fonts. At the moment, TeXmacs
  also needs the bibTeX program for generating bibliographies.
</P>

<H2><b>2. The Guile/Scheme extension language</b></H2>

<P>
  Guile/Scheme is a full implementation of
  the object oriented and lisp-like programming language Scheme.
  It has special support for linking external C or C++ programs.
  This provides a transparent way to dynamically extend
  the language with fast new routines.
  Guile/Scheme is intended to become the major extension language
  for the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</A> and
  <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</A>.
</P>

<P>
  In particular, all high-level TeXmacs editing routines
  have been interfaced to Guile. These routines thereby are
  available to users who can write extensions to the editor,
  without going into the C++ code of TeXmacs.
  In the future, we also wish to implement a port to Guile-gtk.
  This extension of Guile implements a graphical user interface
  via gtk, which makes it possible to create menus, iconbars,
  file selectors, etc. in a very simple way.
</P>
