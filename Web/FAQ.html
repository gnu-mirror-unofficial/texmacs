  <B>Question 1.</B>
  <EM>
    How can I see the LaTeX or TeX code corresponding
    to what I see on the screen?
  </EM> 
</P>

<Blockquote>
  <B>Answer.</B> This question is due to a fundamental misunderstanding
  about TeXmacs. Indeed, TeXmacs is not <EM>based</EM>
  on TeX/LaTeX, although it does support (not yet perfect)
  <EM>conversion</EM> to and from LaTeX.
  Furthermore, in theory at least, there is actually no need
  anymore to look at something like the TeX source,
  since TeXmacs is guaranteed to be fully WYSIWYG.
  Conversion to LaTeX may only be useful,
  when transmitting an accepted paper to the publisher of a journal.

  <B>Question 2.</B>
  <EM>
    I just installed TeXmacs, but when I start typing or
    when I take a look at the help, TeXmacs hangs for a minute.
    In the terminal where I launched the program,
    I also see that my disk is being filled with files.
  </EM> 
</P>

<Blockquote>
  <B>Answer.</B> This behaviour is normal.
  TeXmacs calls Metafont in order to generate fonts which are
  not yet present. The first time you launch TeXmacs,
  many fonts may therefore have to be generated.
  If order to avoid this, you may download some
  <A HREF="../Download/Fonts.html" TARGET="Main">pregenerated fonts</A>.

  <B>Question 3.</B>
  <EM>
    Why don't you use a common graphical user interface like GTK
    for your scrollbars, menus, and so on ?
  </EM> 
</P>

<Blockquote>
  <B>Answer.</B> When I started to develop TeXmacs about four
  years ago, the common graphical user interfaces were not as good as
  nowadays. Moreover, I wanted the GUI to support some special features,
  like TeX fonts in the menus.
  Nevertheless, now that graphical user interfaces did become much better,
  I plan to switch to guile-gtk as soon as possible.
  Using Guile-gtk in combination with TeXmacs
  has three main advantages:
  <OL>
    <LI> One has full access to the GTK widget set,
         which includes menus, scrollable windows,
         file choosers, iconbars, etc.</LI>
    <LI> Guile-gtk provides you with a very flexible and
         customizable way to use these widgets.</LI>
    <LI> The incorporation of Guile-gtk in TeXmacs
         should be natural, since TeXmacs already supports
         the Guile/Scheme extension language.</LI>
  </OL>

<P>
  <B>Question 4.</B>
  <EM>
    A publisher sent me a giant LateX preamble I'm supposed to put in in
    order to prepare a book for them.  What is the best way of putting it in
    and figuring if it will work?
  </EM>
</P>

<Blockquote>
  <B>Answer.</B> I recommand to convert the preamble to TeXmacs and
  to put the result in a TeXmacs style file. However,
  the result will probably be disappointing, because conversion
  between TeX/LaTeX and TeXmacs is not yet perfect and style files
  are particularly problematic. What you can also do is write
  a TeXmacs style file by your own which supports the major extra
  constructs you want to use from the editors style file.
  When you convert your book to LaTeX, you next use the editors style.
  Some layout will probably need to be redone at that stage,
  but this should actually be the work of the editor...
  Please look in the TeXmacs help for more information about
  convertions between TeXmacs and LaTeX.

  <B>Question 5.</B>
  <EM>
    What are the differences between TeXmacs and LyX?
  </EM>
</P>

<Blockquote>
  <B>Answer.</B> TeXmacs is a more ambitious project.
  Some of its major advantages are the following:
  <OL>
    <LI> TeXmacs is fully WYSIWYG. </LI>
    <LI> TeXmacs is more readable on the screen. </LI>
    <LI> You may extend the editor by defining ``fully dynamic macros''. </LI>
    <LI> TeXmacs comes with the Guile/Scheme extension language. </LI>
    <LI> You can use TeXmacs as an interface to computer algebra systems. </LI>
  </OL>
