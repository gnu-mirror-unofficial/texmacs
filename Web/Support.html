<P>
  In order to get user support on TeXmacs, the best thing you can do
  (especially when you are a novice) is to suscribe to the TeXmacs
  mailing list <tt>texmacs-users@texmacs.org</tt>,
  by <A HREF="mailto:sympa@texmacs.org?subject=SUBSCRIBE%20texmacs-users">sending</A>
  an email to <tt>sympa@texmacs.org</tt> with a subject of the form
  <pre>
    SUBSCRIBE texmacs-users Your Full Name
  </pre>
  You may unsubscribe later on by
  <A HREF="mailto:sympa@texmacs.org?subject=SIGNOFF%20texmacs-users">sending</A>
  an email to <tt>sympa@texmacs.org</tt> with
  <pre>
    SIGNOFF texmacs-users
  </pre>
  as subject. The
  <A HREF="http://listes.hautesavoie.net/wws/arc/texmacs-users"><tt>texmacs-users</tt> mailing list archives</A>
  are also available without subscription.
</P>

<P>
  Similarly, if you are just interested in receiving information about
  major new releases of TeXmacs, or other major relevant information
  related to the program, you may suscribe to the mailing list
  <tt>info@texmacs.org</tt>. This is done by
  <A HREF="mailto:sympa@texmacs.org?subject=SUBSCRIBE%20texmacs-info">sending</A>
  an email to <tt>sympa@texmacs.org</tt> with a subject of the form
  <pre>
    SUBSCRIBE texmacs-info Your Full Name
  </pre>
  The number of messages you will receive in this case should
  not exceed something like four a year. Again, you may unsuscribe
  yourself by
  <A HREF="mailto:sympa@texmacs.org?subject=SIGNOFF texmacs-info">sending</A>
  an email to <tt>sympa@texmacs.org</tt> with
  <pre>
    SIGNOFF texmacs-info
  </pre>
  as subject.
</P>

<P>
  For more information about how to use the mailing lists, please
  <A HREF="mailto:sympa@texmacs.org?subject=HELP">send</A>
  an email to <tt>sympa@texmacs.org</tt> with <tt>HELP</TT> as it's subject.
  For support on TeXmacs, you may also directly
  <A href="Mail.html">contact</A> the TeXmacs developers.
</P>

<P>
  A new and efficient (though experimental) way to get
  more documentation or support for TeXmacs, is to consult the
  <A HREF="http://www.alqua.com/tmresources" TARGET="_top">TeXmacs Wiki</A>.
  This is an interactive forum where users can ask questions about
  specific topics, but also participate themselves to the documentation
  effort and to answering questions from other users. In the future,
  the whole TeXmacs website might work in a similar way.
