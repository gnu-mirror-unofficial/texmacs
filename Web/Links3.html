  Computer algebra systems with links to GNU TeXmacs
</FONT></B><BR></P>

<BR>

<P>
  TeXmacs can be linked to several free and proprietary computer
  algebra systems. On this page, we only mention the free ones.

<H2>1. Macaulay 2</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2">Macaulay 2</A>
  is a new software system devoted to supporting research in
  algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The software is available now
  in source code for porting, and in compiled form for Linux, SunOS,
  Solaris, Windows, and a few other unix machines.
  An interface with TeXmacs is currently being implemented.

<H2>2. Maxima</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima.html">Maxima</A>
  is not alone one of the oldest and best computer algebra systems around,
  it is also one of the only general purpose systems for which there
  is a free implementation. The free Maxima implementation is maintained
  by <A HREF="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs">William F. Schelter</A>.
  Here follow some feautures of Maxima:
  <ul>
    <li> Plotting via netmath over the network.
    <li> Computations over network
    <li> Well tested on a large array of problems.
    <li> Source level Debugger for maxima code
    <li> Documentation available as html, texinfo, info, dvi and postscript.
         The documentation can be read inside TeXmacs.
    <li> Easy to extend in fundamentally new ways, because
         you have complete access to source, and access to Common Lisp.
    <li> Portable to many systems.
  </ul>

<H2>3. Pari</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://www.parigp-home.de">Pari-gp</A>
  is a software package for computer-aided
  number theory. It consists of a C library, <CODE>libpari</CODE>
  (with optional assembler cores for some popular architectures),
  and of the programmable interactive <KBD>gp</KBD> calculator.
  While you can write your own <CODE>libpari</CODE>-based programs,
  many people just start up a <KBD>gp</KBD> session, or have <KBD>gp</KBD>
  execute their scripts. Pari sessions can now be started
  inside TeXmacs.

  Originally developed at
  <A HREF="http://www.cribx1.u-bordeaux.fr/">Bordeaux</A>
  by a team led by
  <A HREF="http://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~cohen/">Henri Cohen</A>,
  PARI-GP is now maintained by <EM>Karim Belabas</EM> at the
  <A HREF="http://www.math.u-psud.fr/">Universit&eacute; Paris-Sud Orsay</A>
  with the help of many volunteer contributors.

<H2>4. gTybalt</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://www.fis.unipr.it/~stefanw/gtybalt.html">gTybalt</A>
  is a free computer algebra system which is built on
  top of GiNaC, CLN and a program to interpret C and C++ commands.
  gTybalt, which is still in an experimental stage, is maintained by
  <A HREF="http://www.fis.unipr.it/~stefanw">Stefan Weinzierl</A>.
  Some of the main features of gTybalt are the following:
  <UL>
    <LI> Object Oriented: gTybalt allows symbolic calculations within 
         the C++ programming language.
    <LI> Efficiency for large scale problems:
         Solutions developed with gTybalt can be compiled with
         a C++ compiler and executed independently of gTybalt.
    <LI> Short development cycle: gTybalt can interpret C++ and
         execute C++ scripts. Solutions can be developed quickly for
         small-scale problems, either interactively or through scripts,
         and once debugged, the solutions can be compiled and scaled up
         to large-scale problems.

<H2>5. Qcl</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html">QCL</a>
  is a high level, architecture independent programming language
  for quantum computers, with a syntax derived from classical procedural
  languages like C or Pascal. This allows for the complete implementation and
  simulation of quantum algorithms (including classical components)
  in one consistent formalism. QCL is developed by
  <A HREF="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html">Bernhard Ömer</a>.
  The TeXmacs interface is mainly useful for displaying quantum states
  in a readable way.

<H2>6. Yacas</H2>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~apinkus/yacas.html">Yacas</A> is,
  as it's name suggest, yet another computer algebra system.
  Things implemented include: arbitrary precision, rational numeric,
  vector, complex, and matrix computations (including inverses and
  determinants and solving matrix equations), derivatives, solving,
  Taylor series, numerical solving (Newtons method),
  and a lot more non-mathematical algorithms.
  The language natively supports variables and user-defined functions.
  There is basic support for univariate polynomials,
  integrating functions and tensor calculations.
  Yacas is still under development.
