<P>
  In order to run GNU TeXmacs, you should have
  <A HREF="Links1.html">installed</A> a TeX distribution
  on your system, as well as the Guile/Scheme extension language.
  Below, we will shortly describe some other programs,
  which may cooperate with TeXmacs,
  although they are not really essential.

<H2>1. Ghostscript and ghostview</H2>

<P>
  In order to display images TeXmacs relies on
  the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">ghostscript</A> program.
  This program makes it possible to display postscripts graphics
  in X Window applications.
  Other programs like <tt>tiff2ps</tt>, <tt>pnmtops</tt>,
  <tt>giftopnm</tt>, etc. are used to convert other image
  formats into postscript.
</P>

<P>
  The <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">ghostview</A> program
  is a popular postscript file viewer based on ghostscript.
  It may be used in combination with TeXmacs
  for previewing documents before you print them.

<H2><b>2. Xfig</b></H2>

<P>
  The <A HREF="http://duke.usask.ca/~macphed/soft/fig" TARGET="_top">xfig</A> program
  can be used for creating technical pictures, which may be included
  in TeXmacs documents. A nice feature of xfig is that
  you may include LaTeX formulas in pictures.
  Furthermore, this feature may be used in combination with TeXmacs,
  which will call LaTeX to transform the LaTeX formula
  into postscript.
